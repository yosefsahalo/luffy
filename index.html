        <p>Monkey D Luffy the main character in the series.Luffy is the captain of 'Straw Hat Pirates'. It's called
            "Straw Hat" Luffy. At the age of 7 he accidentally ate a 'devil' fruit called 'gumo gum no mi' of the
            Paramasia type, which gave him the strength and body properties of a rubber, at the cost of losing the
            ability to swim. (As for any other devil fruit user). His dream is to find the legendary treasure known as
            'Van Pais' and become the pirate king, there are those who think that Luffy is similar to Roger in his
            behavior or his ability to think. He is very fond of meat and eats huge amounts of food. Luffy is very
            innocent and often makes up abbreviations for names. He's one of the 11 supernovae, a group of novice
            pirates who are wanted for sums in excess of 100,000,000. Luffy acts on instinct and is not worried about
            the consequences of his actions, for example beating a world nobleman without being worried about an admiral
            who is supposed to arrive in such a case. When he defeated the most powerful pirates in the East Blue, a
            prize of 30,000,000 without (the money in the world of One Piece) was set on his head. After defeating the
            pirate and Shichibukai Crocodile, the prize on his head was raised to 100,000,000. Following the events in
            the lobby lobby, the prize again rose to 300,000,000 without. After taking an active part in the escape of
            many inmates from the Impale Down Prison, and in the attack on Marineford, the reward on his head again rose
            to 400,000,000. During the 'Anise Lobby' saga, Luffy revealed two techniques, Gear Second, which allows
            Luffy to make the blood in his body run fast, which is why Luffy's body turns purple and steam escapes his
            body, his strength and speed increase. A second technique is Gear Third which allows Luffy to inflate part
            of his body and make it bigger, making his attacks stronger, but this gear has a disadvantage because after
            Luffy uses this gear his body becomes small for a minute (after the TS Luffy is able to use In this
            technique without its disadvantage). Luffy is one of the youngest characters in the series and also the most
            childish. This is evidenced by recurring traits in him such as: extensive use of slang, fondness for
            childish games, innocence, kindness and inability to lie.</p>
